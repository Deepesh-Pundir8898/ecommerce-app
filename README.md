# E-Commerce Application Backend (Node.js)

## Overview
This is a backend API for an eCommerce platform built with Node.js. It leverages the power of Node.jsâ€™s non-blocking I/O and event-driven architecture to provide a scalable, performant, and real-time solution suitable for modern eCommerce applications. 

The project aims to create a robust RESTful API that will manage various aspects of the platform, including user authentication, product management, blog management, and order processing, among other essential features. By practicing on this eCommerce application, you will learn how to handle asynchronous operations, implement secure authentication, and scale an application to meet growing demands.

## Features
In the upcoming classes, you will work on implementing the following features:
- **User Authentication API**: Secure user login and registration using JWT tokens and cookies.
- **Product Management API**: CRUD operations for managing products, including sorting and pagination.
- **User Management API**: Admin panel for managing user accounts.
- **Blog Management API**: CRUD operations for creating, liking, and commenting on blog posts.
- **Category and Wishlist API**: Manage product categories and users' wishlists.
- **Address, Coupon, and Cart Management API**: Handle user addresses, coupon codes, and cart management.
- **Order and Payment Integration**: Manage orders and integrate a payment gateway.

## Outcomes
By the end of this project, you will have:
- Implemented a RESTful API server that serves as the backend for the eCommerce platform.
- Ensured secure user authentication and authorization using JWT tokens and cookies.
